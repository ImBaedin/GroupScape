# Agent Instructions

- After making changes, run a TypeScript typecheck (`tsc --noEmit`) for the affected package(s) and fix any issues.
- Avoid running `convex codegen` here; it repeatedly fails due to blocked network/Sentry and wastes time. Instead, the user is responsible for running the dev server.
